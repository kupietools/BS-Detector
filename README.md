# BS-Detector

*** The Internet Bad Statements Detector is a tool to help you fact-check info you find online before you pass it along on social media or elsewhere.

The BS Detector is designed to aid in online research and to help prevent people from passing along nonsense on the internet, by making it easier to look stuff up on Snopes.com, Politifact, FactCheck.org, and other myth-busting websites all at once.

It works very simply: drag a “Detect BS” button to your bookmarks bar. Then, while you surf the web, you can select text on any web page and click your “Detect BS” bookmark link. This will pop up no-nonsense links from a multitude of sites that tell you if it’s well-known BS (plus offer you some sharing options right from the results popup.)

Interested? Check it out. (Right now the instructions on the BS Detector page are a little wordy. Please read ’em. I’m working on simplifying them.)

I really feel like I’ve done something good for humanity with this. Hopefully more people will start fact-checking Bad Statements themselves and rumors before they post them on Facebook, so people like me don’t have to harsh on them anymore for not checking Snopes first.

As of this writing, the Internet Bad Statements detector is live on the web at https://bsdetector.info

*** For webmasters: 

Here’s where it gets neat. KupieTools is handcrafted artisanal portable code, including features which I have not yet documented, but which allow webmasters to copy and host any tool on their own servers with zero configuration and no futzing around required… one single file serves all necessary scripts and images, allows you to download its php source and repost on your own server, automagically updates its self-contained bookmarklet code to work from wherever you put it, and even provides update alerts when the copy you got it from has been updated to a newer version.

It also provides a plug-and-play framework if you develop your own javascript apps… simply enter your javascript code and HTML pages in a function within the file. It automatically gets deployed as a bookmarklet, with the built-in advantages of absolute portability, update checking, and more. Its complete portability and upstream version checking present a new peer-to-peer model of software distribution.

These features will be activated as soon as I’ve got the code tidy enough that I’m not embarrassed at the thought of someone seeing it.
